RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, I cannot answer this question. The text discusses screen sizes in inches and centimeters but does not provide a direct conversion for a 24-inch TV.

Standard LLM Answer:
A 24-inch TV is approximately **61 centimeters**.

Here'**s the breakdown:**

*   1 inch = 2.54 centimeters
*   24 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 60.96 cm

So, it's very close to 61 cm.



**Important Note:** When we say a TV is "24 inches," we're referring to the size of the screen diagonally.
