Standard LLM Answer:
This is a deep dive into the incredibly niche and dedicated fanbase of "Alone" and its spin-off, "Alone: The Gauntlet." You're referencing a very specific question within that community!

The answer is **Ashley Abbott**.

Here's the breakdown:

*   **"Alone: The Gauntlet"** is a competition where contestants from previous seasons of "Alone" face a series of back-to-back survival challenges.
*   **"Alone: The Gauntlet Season 2"** featured a unique twist where contestants were paired up and had to survive together for a period, then faced individual challenges.
*   **Ashley Abbott** and her partner, Celene, were the last team remaining in the partnered portion of the challenge. While Celene ultimately tapped out, Ashley persevered through the individual challenges and was declared the winner.



It's a testament to the dedicated following of "Alone" that such a specific question exists and is so widely discussed!
