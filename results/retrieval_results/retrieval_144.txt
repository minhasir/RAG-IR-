RAG Answer:
Stephen Fuller Austin is known as the "Father of Texas".

Standard LLM Answer:
This is a great question with a layered answer! Here's the breakdown of who is known as the "Father of Texas" and why it's a bit complicated:

**1. Stephen F. Austin is most widely considered the "Father of Texas."**

*   **Why?** He's credited with bringing the first 300 American settlers (the "Old 300") to Texas under a contract with the Mexican government. He successfully established a thriving Anglo-American colony in Texas, which was a crucial factor in the region's development and eventual independence. He was a skilled diplomat and negotiator, navigating the complex relationship between the Texan settlers and the Mexican government for many years.

**2. However, there's a case to be made for others:**

*   **Moses Austin:** Stephen F. Austin's father, Moses Austin, initially secured the land grant from the Mexican government that allowed Anglo-American colonization to begin. However, he died before he could see his plan fully realized. Some argue he deserves the title due to his initial efforts.
*   **Sam Houston:** While Austin laid the groundwork, Sam Houston was instrumental in the Texas Revolution. He commanded the Texan army at the Battle of San Jacinto, securing Texas's independence from Mexico. His later role as governor and senator also solidified his importance in Texas history.

**In conclusion:** While several individuals contributed significantly to Texas's history, **Stephen F. Austin** is most commonly and rightfully recognized as the "Father of Texas" due to his foundational role in establishing the Anglo-American settlements that shaped the region.
