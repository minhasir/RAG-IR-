Okay, this is a *big* question, as the 19th century saw a huge number of reform movements across the globe. Here's a breakdown, organized by region/movement type, with key leaders.

*   **Leadership is Complex:**  "Leadership" can be defined in different ways. Some leaders were charismatic figures, others were organizers, and still others were intellectuals who shaped the ideas behind the movements.
*   **Intersectionality:** Many of these movements overlapped and influenced each other. For example, the women's rights movement was often intertwined with the abolitionist movement.
*   **Regional Variation:**  Within each region, there were significant differences in the nature of reform movements and the leaders involved.
*   **Focus on Prominent Figures:** This list tends to highlight more well-known figures. Many unsung heroes and grassroots organizers were crucial to the success of these movements.
*   **Timeline:** The 19th century spanned 100 years, and the prominence of leaders and the nature of movements changed over time.
