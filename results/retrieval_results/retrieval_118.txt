RAG Answer:
Chris Pine plays Lord Nicholas Devereaux in The Princess Diaries 2.

Standard LLM Answer:
This is a tricky one! You're asking about two different characters.

*   **Nicholas in *The Princess Diaries 2*** is played by **Jonathan Tesser**.
*   **Nicholas Devereaux in *The Princess Diaries 3*** is played by **Robert Schwartzman**.

It'|s easy to get them mixed up because they are both named Nicholas and appear in the same series!
