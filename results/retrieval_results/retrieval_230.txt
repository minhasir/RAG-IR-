Question: the gas released by plants is used by organisms to do what

Reference Answer: Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms ' activities ( energy transformation )

In plants , algae , and cyanobacteria , photosynthesis releases oxygen

. In most cases , oxygen is also released as a waste product . Most plants , most algae , and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis ; such organisms are called photoautotrophs . Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth 's atmosphere , and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for life on Earth .

In hot and dry conditions , plants close their stomata to prevent water loss . Under these conditions , CO will decrease and oxygen gas , produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis , will increase , causing an increase of photorespiration by the oxygenase activity of ribulose - 1 , 5 - bisphosphate carboxylase / oxygenase and decrease in carbon fixation . Some plants have evolved mechanisms to increase the CO concentration in the leaves under these conditions .

RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, the gas released by plants (oxygen) is used by organisms to do what is not explicitly stated. However, the text indicates photosynthesis "supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for life on Earth."

Standard LLM Answer:
The gas released by plants (oxygen) is used by organisms to **respire** â€“ to create energy for their life processes.



Essentially, it's the foundation of the food chain and how most living things get the energy they need.
