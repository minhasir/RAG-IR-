RAG Answer:
The name of the band derives from Bastille Day, which is celebrated on 14 July, the date of Smith's birthday.

Standard LLM Answer:
This is a fun one! The band Bastille got their name from the **Rue de la Bastille** in Paris, France.

Here's the story:

*   **Dan Smith**, the lead singer of Bastille, lived in a flat on that street for a while.
*   He was inspired by the name of the street, which itself refers to the **Bastille**, a medieval fortress and prison in Paris. The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, was a pivotal event in the French Revolution.
*   Smith felt the name "Bastille" had a strong, evocative quality and felt it would be a good name for a band.

So, it's a connection to a specific place in Paris and, indirectly, to a significant historical event.
