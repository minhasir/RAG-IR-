Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down the legal drinking age around the world, and specifically in the US. It's more complex than a simple number!

**United States:**

*   **The Big One: 21.** The legal drinking age in every state in the US is 21. This is a federal law (National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984). States that don't comply with this law lose a percentage of their federal highway funds.
*   **Exceptions:** There are limited exceptions, primarily related to:
    *   **Religious ceremonies:** Some states allow consumption for religious purposes.
    *   **Wine tasting:** Some states allow individuals of legal drinking age (often 18 or 19) to sample wine at a winery or vineyard, often with restrictions.
    *   **Parental consent:** A few states allow consumption of alcohol by minors with the consent of a parent or guardian.

**Around the World - It Varies Widely!**

Here's a snapshot of legal drinking ages in other countries (as of late 2023/early 2024 - these can change):

*   **16:** Austria, Belgium (beer and wine only), Germany (beer and wine only), Netherlands (beer and wine only), Switzerland
*   **17:** Denmark, Norway, Portugal
*   **18:** Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, United Kingdom (England & Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland)
*   **19:**  Belgium (stronger alcohol), Canada (Quebec)
*   **20:**  Some countries have varying ages depending on the type of alcohol or the situation.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **"Legal" Doesn't Mean "Allowed Everywhere":** Even if the legal drinking age is 18 in a country, there may be restrictions on where and when alcohol can be consumed by minors.
*   **Enforcement:** Laws on the books don't always mean they are strictly enforced.
*   **Cultural Norms:**  Drinking habits and attitudes towards underage drinking vary significantly from country to country.
