Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's pinpoint Zimbabwe's location!

**Zimbabwe is located in Southern Africa.**

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **Continent:** Africa
*   **Region:** Southern Africa
*   **Neighbors:**
    *   **South:** South Africa
    *   **North:** Zambia
    *   **East:** Mozambique
    *   **West:** Botswana
*   **Coordinates (approximate):** 20° South, 33° East

**Think of it this way:** If you look at a map of Africa, look for the countries South Africa, Zambia, Mozambique, and Botswana. Zimbabwe sits nestled between them. It's a landlocked country, meaning it doesn't have a coastline.
