RAG Answer:
In July 2005.

Standard LLM Answer:
You're hitting on a really important and complex piece of tech history! Let's break down the acquisition of Android by Google, and clarify some common points of confusion.

**The Core Facts:**

*   **Android wasn't "acquired" in the traditional sense of buying out a company.** Google didn't buy the *entire* Android company.
*   **Android Inc. was founded in 2003.** Initially, it was a secretive company working on mobile operating systems. They pivoted several times, originally aiming for advanced cameras, then a tablet OS, and finally, a mobile OS.
*   **Google bought the *team* and the *Android OS technology* in 2005.**  Google purchased Android Inc. for an estimated $47.5 million.  Crucially, the company itself was essentially dissolved.  The key assets – the Android operating system and, more importantly, the talented engineers who were developing it – were absorbed into Google.
*   **Open Sourcing:**  A pivotal decision was Google's decision to **open-source** the Android operating system in 2007. This meant making the source code publicly available, allowing other companies to use, modify, and distribute it. This was a strategic move to foster a broad ecosystem of Android devices and applications.

**Why was this significant?**

*   **Counter to Apple:** At the time, Apple was dominating the smartphone market with the iPhone. Google needed a mobile operating system to compete, and acquiring Android provided a foundation.
*   **Open Ecosystem:** The open-source nature of Android allowed a wide range of manufacturers (Samsung, HTC, LG, etc.) to build devices running Android. This created a diverse and competitive market, unlike Apple's closed ecosystem.
*   **App Ecosystem:** The Android Market (later Google Play Store) allowed developers to create and distribute apps, further fueling the platform's growth.

**In short:** Google didn't buy a company and keep it running. They bought the *technology* and the *people* behind Android, and then strategically open-sourced it to create a dominant mobile operating system.



Do you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this, like the reasons behind the open-source decision, the early challenges of Android, or its impact on the mobile landscape?
