Standard LLM Answer:
This is a tricky question with a complex answer! Here's a breakdown of who has climbed the Great Wall of China, broken down into categories:

**1. Historical Figures & Emperors:**

*   **Qin Shi Huang (221-206 BC):** The first emperor of China, he ordered the initial construction of connected walls, which are considered the precursor to the Great Wall. He didn't "climb" it in the modern sense, but he oversaw its construction.
*   **Various Emperors of Subsequent Dynasties (Han, Ming, etc.):** Throughout history, emperors and their entourages would have traveled along and, in some cases, climbed sections of the Wall for military inspections, ceremonial purposes, and hunting.

**2. Military Personnel & Guards:**

*   **Soldiers and Guards:** Throughout its history, countless soldiers and guards were stationed along the Wall, patrolling and defending it. They would have regularly climbed and traversed its sections.

**3. Explorers & Foreigners (Historically):**

*   **Missionaries:** In the 17th and 18th centuries, Jesuit missionaries like Giuseppe Castelli (also known as Matteo Ricci) were among the first Europeans to document and explore the Great Wall. They climbed sections of it to reach Beijing.
*   **Early Western Travelers:** As China gradually opened up to the West, explorers and travelers like William Alexander and Ernest J. Satow visited and documented the Wall, often including climbs in their accounts.

**4. Modern-Day Climbers & Tourists:**

*   **Tourists:** Millions of tourists from around the world visit the Great Wall each year, and many of them climb sections of it.
*   **Adventure Climbers:** Some climbers have undertaken more challenging climbs of the Wall, including sections that are unrestored or difficult to access.
*   **Record-Breaking Climbers:** There have been attempts to climb the entire length of the Wall (which is difficult to define precisely due to its fragmented nature) for charity or personal achievement.

**5. Symbolic Climbers:**

*   **Athletes:**  The Great Wall has been used as a backdrop for athletic events, and athletes have "climbed" it as part of those events.
*   **Celebrities:** Many celebrities have visited and posed on the Great Wall, creating iconic images.



**Important Considerations:**

*   **Defining "Climbing":** The term "climbing" can be interpreted differently. Does it mean a short walk on a restored section, or a technical ascent of a steep, unrestored portion?
*   **Length and Fragmentation:** The Great Wall isn't a single, continuous structure. It's a series of walls, fortifications, and natural barriers stretching over thousands of kilometers.
*   **Accessibility:** Some sections of the Wall are well-maintained and easily accessible, while others are remote, crumbling, and dangerous to climb.



**In conclusion, countless individuals throughout history have "climbed" the Great Wall of China, from emperors and soldiers to explorers and modern-day tourists. It's a symbol of China and a destination for adventurers from around the world.**
