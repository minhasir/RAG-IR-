Winkler was able to prepare several new compounds of germanium , including fluorides , chlorides , sulfides , dioxide , and tetraethylgermane ( Ge ( C H ) ) , the first organogermane . The physical data from those compounds -- which corresponded well with Mendeleev 's predictions -- made the discovery an important confirmation of Mendeleev 's idea of element periodicity . Here is a comparison between the prediction and Winkler 's data :

Germanium is a chemical element with symbol Ge and atomic number 32 . It is a lustrous , hard , grayish - white metalloid in the carbon group , chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon . Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon . Like silicon , germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature .

Under standard conditions , germanium is a brittle , silvery - white , semi-metallic element . This form constitutes an allotrope known as α - germanium , which has a metallic luster and a diamond cubic crystal structure , the same as diamond . At pressures above 120 kbar , it becomes the allotrope β - germanium with the same structure as β - tin . Like silicon , gallium , bismuth , antimony , and water , germanium is one of the few substances that expands as it solidifies ( i.e

RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, I cannot answer this question. The provided text describes germanium's properties and relationships to other elements, but it does not mention any noble gases or their position in the periodic table.

Standard LLM Answer:
The noble gas in the same period as germanium is **selenium (Se)**.

Here's why:

*   **Germanium (Ge)** is in Group 14 (also known as the Carbon Group) of the periodic table.
*   **Noble gases** are in Group 18.
*   The periodic table is arranged in periods (rows). Germanium is in Period 5.
*   Therefore, the noble gas in the same period (Period 5) is selenium (Se).
