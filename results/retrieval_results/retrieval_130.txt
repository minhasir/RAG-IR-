RAG Answer:
Paris and Constantinople (Istanbul).

Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, this is a fascinating and complex question with a surprisingly murky history! Here's a breakdown of the original route of the Orient Express, and the evolution of its legend, separating fact from fiction.

**1. The Early Days: "Paris-to-Orient" (1883-1891)**

*   **Not a Single Train, But a Network:** The "Orient Express" wasn't initially a single, continuous train. It was a concept – a way to travel from Paris to Constantinople (now Istanbul) using a combination of trains and ferries.
*   **The Initial Route (1883):**
    *   **Paris to Munich:** Compagnie des Wagons-Lits (CIWL) started with a luxury train from Paris Gare de l'Est to Munich.
    *   **Munich to Vienna:** Passengers transferred to another train in Munich to reach Vienna.
    *   **Vienna to Bucharest:**  Another train took them to Bucharest.
    *   **Bucharest to Ruse (Bulgaria):**  A train journey.
    *   **Ruse to Varna (Bulgaria):**  A train journey.
    *   **Varna to Constantinople (Istanbul):** A ferry across the Black Sea.
*   **1889: Direct Rail to Constantinople:** The crucial development was the completion of the Serbian state railways, allowing a direct rail connection from Belgrade to Constantinople. This eliminated the ferry crossing. The route then became:
    *   **Paris Gare de l'Est to Belgrade:** Luxury train operated by CIWL.
    *   **Belgrade to Constantinople (Istanbul):**  Another CIWL train.

**2. The "Simplon Orient Express" (1895-1914) - The Route We Think Of**

*   **The Simplon Pass Opens:** The opening of the Simplon Tunnel (through the Swiss Alps) in 1895 dramatically changed the route. It provided a much faster and more scenic route from Western Europe to Italy.
*   **The New Route (1895 onwards):**
    *   **Paris Gare de l'Est to Paris Gare de Lyon:** Passengers initially traveled to Paris Gare de Lyon.
    *   **Paris Gare de Lyon to Milan:**  Luxury train.
    *   **Milan to Venice:** Luxury train.
    *   **Venice to Trieste:** Luxury train.
    *   **Trieste to Belgrade:** Luxury train.
    *   **Belgrade to Sofia:** Luxury train.
    *   **Sofia to Constantinople (Istanbul):** Luxury train.

**3. Post-WWI and Beyond**

*   **Route Variations:** After World War I, the political landscape changed, and the route was adjusted several times.
*   **The "Orient-Express" (1930s):**  The train was rebranded as the "Orient-Express" in the 1930s.
*   **The Final Route (Before Suspension):** The last regular route before the service was suspended in 1977 was:
    *   **Paris to Munich**
    *   **Munich to Villach (Austria)**
    *   **Villach to Trieste**
    *   **Trieste to Belgrade**
    *   **Belgrade to Sofia**
    *   **Sofia to Istanbul**

**Key Points & Misconceptions:**

*   **No Single "Original" Route:** The route evolved significantly over time.
*   **CIWL's Role:** The Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL) was the company that operated the luxury carriages and played a central role in the Orient Express's success.
*   **The Agatha Christie Connection:** Agatha Christie's novel "Murder on the Orient Express" (1934) cemented the train's image in popular culture, but her depiction of the route was based on a specific, later iteration of the journey.
*   **The Venice Simplon Orient Express Today:** The Venice Simplon Orient Express, which operates today, is a recreation of the train's golden age, using restored carriages and following a route inspired by the 1930s era.



To help me narrow down the answer further, could you tell me:

*   Are you interested in a specific period of the Orient Express's history? (e.g., the 1880s, the 1930s)
*   Are you interested in the route that was most famous or romanticized?
