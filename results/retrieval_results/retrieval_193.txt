Standard LLM Answer:
This is a wonderfully tricky question! Here's the breakdown of how Frankenstein and his monster first meet, and why it's a key element of the story:

**They do not meet initially.** Victor Frankenstein, the creator, does not actively seek out or arrange a meeting with his creation.

**The First Encounter:** The monster first appears to Victor *after* Victor has abandoned him. Victor is wandering the Swiss Alps, consumed by horror and disgust at what he has brought into existence. The monster finds him and begins to speak, pleading for understanding and companionship. This encounter happens entirely on the monster's initiative.

**Why this is significant:** This initial meeting is crucial because it establishes the power dynamic and the tragedy of the story. Victor immediately rejects his creation, setting in motion the monster's feelings of abandonment and ultimately, his vengeful actions. It highlights Victor's responsibility for the monster's suffering and the devastating consequences of his actions.
