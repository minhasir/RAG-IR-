Standard LLM Answer:
You're asking a great question that gets at a bit of a symbolic gesture! 

The key to the city is **primarily a symbolic honor**. It doesn'al give you any actual legal privileges or access to anything specific. 

Historically, it meant you were granted free access to the city's gates and hospitality. Today, it's a ceremonial recognition of an individual's contributions to the city. 

Here's what it *entitles* you to, in a figurative sense:

*   **Recognition and Honor:** It's a public acknowledgement of your achievements and service.
*   **Goodwill:** It's a gesture of friendship and appreciation from the city.
*   **Bragging Rights:** It's a pretty cool honor to have!
*   **Sometimes, a party!** Often, a key presentation is accompanied by a ceremony or reception.

Essentially, it's a very nice gesture, but it doesn't open any doors (literally) that weren't already open to you. It's about the sentiment, not the access.
