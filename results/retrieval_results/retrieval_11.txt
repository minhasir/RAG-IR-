RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, I cannot answer this question.

Standard LLM Answer:
This is a trick question referencing the TV show "Star Trek: Voyager". 

Tom Paris was demoted to Ensign again after the episode "Zero Tolerance" due to a strict, no-tolerance policy regarding a breach of the Prime Directive. He had previously been a Lieutenant. 

**He never gets back to Lieutenant.** The show ends with him still as an Ensign. 

So the answer is **never**.
