Sodium bicarbonate is used in BC dry chemical fire extinguishers as an alternative to the more corrosive diammonium phosphate in ABC extinguishers

By controlling the temperature of the condenser , often called a dephlegmator , a reflux still may be used to ensure that higher boiling point components are returned to the flask while lighter elements are passed out to a secondary condenser . This is useful in producing high quality alcoholic beverages , while ensuring that less desirable components ( such as fusel alcohols ) are returned to the primary flask

RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, I cannot answer this question. The text mentions alternatives to a Bunsen burner for heating, including a sand bath, but does not explain the purpose of using sand specifically.

Standard LLM Answer:
This is a fascinating and very specific question! Here's a breakdown of the primary purpose of using sand in a still pot heating bath, particularly in historical contexts (like early glassmaking or metalworking):

**The Primary Purpose: Even Heat Distribution & Thermal Mass**

The key reason for using sand in a still pot (a large, sealed pot used for heating) is to **provide a uniform and stable heat source.** Here's how it works:

*   **Thermal Mass:** Sand has a very high thermal mass. This means it can absorb a large amount of heat energy without a significant temperature change.
*   **Heat Storage & Release:** When a fire is applied to the outside of the still pot, the sand absorbs and stores that heat. It then slowly and evenly releases this heat into the contents of the pot (e.g., molten glass, metal).
*   **Eliminating Hot Spots:** Without the sand, the fire would directly heat the pot, creating uneven temperatures and "hot spots." These hot spots can cause localized overheating, cracking, or other problems with the material being processed. The sand acts as a buffer, distributing the heat more evenly.
*   **Maintaining Temperature:** The sand's thermal mass helps to maintain a relatively constant temperature within the pot, even as the fire fluctuates. This is crucial for processes that require precise temperature control.

**In essence, the sand acts as a giant, slow-release heat reservoir, ensuring a consistent and even temperature for the contents of the still pot.**

**Historical Context & Why It Was Important:**

*   **Early Glassmaking:** Sand was essential in early glassmaking, where precise temperature control was vital for achieving the desired glass properties.
*   **Metalworking:** Similarly, in metalworking, sand baths were used for processes like smelting and alloying, where even heating was crucial.
