Standard LLM Answer:
This is a fascinating and surprisingly complex question! Here's a breakdown of who is generally considered the richest person in history, and why it's so hard to definitively say:

**The Usual Suspect: Mansa Musa of Mali (14th Century)**

* **Why he's #1:** Most historians and economists agree that Mansa Musa (also spelled Musa I) of the Mali Empire was the wealthiest person in history.  It's not just about having a lot of money; it's about the *relative* wealth compared to his kingdom and the global economy of his time.
* **How rich was he?**  Estimates are wildly varying, but the consensus is that his wealth was so vast it's almost impossible to quantify in modern terms.  He controlled a kingdom rich in gold and salt, and his generosity (giving away huge amounts of gold during his pilgrimage to Mecca) famously destabilized economies in surrounding regions.  Some estimates put his wealth at a staggering $400 billion USD in today's money, though this is highly speculative.
* **Why it's hard to compare:**  The economies of the 14th century were vastly different from today's.  Wealth was tied to land, resources, and control of trade routes, not necessarily to financial assets like stocks or bonds.

**Why it's Complicated & Other Contenders:**

* **Augustus Caesar (Roman Emperor):** Some historians argue that Augustus Caesar, with control over the entire Roman Empire, had a wealth equivalent to trillions of dollars. However, quantifying his wealth is difficult due to the complexities of the Roman economy.
* **Genghis Khan (Mongol Emperor):**  While Genghis Khan controlled a vast empire, his wealth was primarily in the form of land, livestock, and tribute.  It's difficult to translate this into a modern monetary value.
* **John D. Rockefeller (19th/20th Century):**  Rockefeller, the oil magnate, was the first billionaire in modern history.  His wealth, at its peak, was estimated to be around $341 billion in today's money.  However, even at that figure, he falls short of the estimated wealth of Mansa Musa.
* **Andrew Carnegie (19th/20th Century):** Another industrialist, Carnegie, also amassed a huge fortune, estimated at around $372 billion in today's money.
* **Modern Billionaires (Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk):** While these individuals have incredible wealth, their fortunes, even combined, are still likely less than Mansa Musa's estimated wealth relative to his time.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Relative Wealth Matters:** It's not just about the absolute number of dollars. It's about how that wealth compared to the overall economy and standard of living of the time.
* **Historical Data is Limited:**  Accurate records of wealth from centuries ago are often incomplete or unreliable.
* **Mansa Musa Remains the Frontrunner:**  Based on current historical understanding, Mansa Musa of Mali is generally considered the richest person in history.
