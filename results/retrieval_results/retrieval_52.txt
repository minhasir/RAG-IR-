RAG Answer:
Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China in 1949.

Standard LLM Answer:
The People's Republic of China was established on October 1, 1949, following a long and complex process. Here's a breakdown of who was primarily responsible:

*   **Mao Zedong:** He was the paramount leader of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the key figure in leading the Chinese Communist Revolution. He declared the establishment of the People's Republic of China in Tiananmen Square. He was the Chairman of the CPC and later the Chairman of the People's Republic of China.
*   **The Chinese Communist Party (CPC):** The CPC, under Mao's leadership, was the driving force behind the revolution and the establishment of the new state. They had been fighting a civil war against the Nationalist government (Kuomintang) for decades.
*   **The People's Liberation Army (PLA):** The PLA, the armed wing of the CPC, played a crucial role in defeating the Nationalist forces and securing control of mainland China.
*   **The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese People's Congress:** This body, formed by the CPC, formally adopted the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and established the state's political structure.

**In essence, Mao Zedong, leading the CPC and supported by the PLA, were the primary forces responsible for establishing the People's Republic of China in 1949.**



It's important to note that the transition was the culmination of a long civil war and a revolution, and many individuals and groups contributed to the eventual outcome.
