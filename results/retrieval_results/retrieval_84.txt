Anything tangible or intangible that can be owned or controlled to produce value and that is held by a company to produce positive economic value is an asset . Simply stated , assets represent value of ownership that can be converted into cash ( although cash itself is also considered an asset ) .

One of the most widely accepted accounting definitions of asset is the one used by the International Accounting Standards Board . The following is a quotation from the IFRS Framework : `` An asset is a resource controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the enterprise .

Standard LLM Answer:
For an asset to be considered money, it must be:

*   **Durable:** It needs to last a reasonable amount of time.
*   **Portable:** It needs to be easy to carry around.
*   **Divisible:** It needs to be possible to break it down into smaller units of value.
*   **Uniform:** Each unit should be essentially the same as every other unit.
*   **Limited in Supply:** Scarcity helps maintain value.
*   **Acceptable as a Medium of Exchange:** Most importantly, people need to widely accept it as payment for goods and services.



These qualities ensure that the asset can function effectively as a store of value, a unit of account, and a medium of exchange â€“ the three core functions of money.
