Standard LLM Answer:
This is a fun historical question! Here's the breakdown:

*   **The First President:** George Washington
*   **The First President to be Photographed:** John Quincy Adams

**Here's the story:**

*   George Washington was president from 1789 to 1797. Photography wasn't invented yet! The first successful photograph wasn't taken until 1826, seven years after Washington's death.
*   John Quincy Adams, who served as president from 1825 to 1829, was the first U.S. president to have his portrait taken. It was a daguerreotype (an early form of photography) taken in 1843, when he was 69 years old. He was quite pleased with the process and sat for several more photographic portraits.
