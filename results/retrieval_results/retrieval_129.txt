Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down the "Project Runway" and Fashion Week schedule. It's a bit complicated and has changed over the years.

**Here's the current situation (as of late 2023/early 2024):**

*   **"Project Runway" does *not* traditionally air during Fashion Week.** This is a key point. It used to, but it no longer does.
*   **"Project Runway" airs on Bravo, typically in the Fall/Winter.** The new seasons usually premiere in the Fall (September/October) and run for several weeks.
*   **Fashion Weeks:** There are two main Fashion Weeks each year:
    *   **New York Fashion Week (NYFW):** Usually held in February/March (Fall/Winter collections) and September (Spring/Summer collections).
    *   **Paris Fashion Week:** Typically follows NYFW, also with Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer collections.
*   **The Connection:** While "Project Runway" doesn't air *during* Fashion Week, the designers are often inspired by the trends and themes presented at Fashion Week. The show often features designs that are very much in line with what's being shown on the runways.

**Therefore, to answer your question directly: "Project Runway" does *not* show at Fashion Week.** It airs on Bravo at a different time of the year, but it's influenced by the trends seen at Fashion Week.



I hope this clarifies the relationship between "Project Runway" and Fashion Week!
