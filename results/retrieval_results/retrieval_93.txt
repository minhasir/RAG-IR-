RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, I cannot answer this question. The text details Liverpool's wins in specific matches and competitions, but doesn't provide a record of whether they've won their first five games in any season.

Standard LLM Answer:
This is a tricky one because it's a specific and relatively rare feat! Here's the breakdown of when Liverpool last won their first five Premier League games:

**Liverpool last won their first five Premier League games in the 2013/14 season.**

Specifically, they achieved it in the following matches:

1.  **August 18, 2013:** Liverpool 3 - 0 Stoke City
2.  **August 25, 2013:** Liverpool 4 - 0 Tottenham Hotspur
3.  **September 1, 2013:** Liverpool 3 - 0 Manchester United
4.  **September 14, 2013:** Liverpool 4 - 1 Southampton
5.  **September 22, 2013:** Liverpool 3 - 1 Newcastle United



It's worth noting that they went on to have a very strong season that year, ultimately finishing second in the Premier League.
