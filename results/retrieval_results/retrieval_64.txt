A new revolution began with electricity and electrification in the electrical industries . The introduction of hydroelectric power generation in the Alps enabled the rapid industrialisation of coal - deprived northern Italy , beginning in the 1890s .

Another major industry of the later Industrial Revolution was gas lighting . Though others made a similar innovation elsewhere , the large - scale introduction of this was the work of William Murdoch , an employee of Boulton & Watt , the Birmingham steam engine pioneers . The process consisted of the large - scale gasification of coal in furnaces , the purification of the gas ( removal of sulphur , ammonia , and heavy hydrocarbons ) , and its storage and distribution

Use of coal in iron smelting started somewhat before the Industrial Revolution , based on innovations by Sir Clement Clerke and others from 1678 , using coal reverberatory furnaces known as cupolas . These were operated by the flames playing on the ore and charcoal or coke mixture , reducing the oxide to metal . This has the advantage that impurities ( such as sulphur ash ) in the coal do not migrate into the metal . This technology was applied to lead from 1678 and to copper from 1687

RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, I cannot answer this question. The text mentions electricity and electrification as the beginning of a revolution, but does not attribute its invention to a specific person.

Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, this is a layered question that gets at a really important and complex period in history. Let's break it down and address each part. There's no single "inventor" of electricity during the Industrial Revolution, but rather a series of discoveries, inventions, and improvements that built upon each other.

Here's a breakdown, addressing the different aspects of your question:

**1. Who "Invented" Electricity? (A tricky question!)**

*   **Ancient Observations:** The phenomenon of static electricity (like rubbing a balloon on your hair) was known to the ancient Greeks (Thales of Miletus, around 600 BC). They observed that amber, when rubbed, attracted light objects. This wasn't "electricity" as we understand it, but it was an early awareness of electrical effects.
*   **17th & 18th Century Foundations:** Key figures in the 17th and 18th centuries laid the groundwork for understanding electricity:
    *   **William Gilbert (1600):** Coined the term "electricus" (from the Greek word for amber) and distinguished between magnetic and electrical forces.
    *   **Benjamin Franklin (1752):** His famous kite experiment demonstrated that lightning is a form of electricity. He also established the concept of positive and negative charges.
    *   **Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1785):** Developed Coulomb's Law, which describes the force between electric charges.
    *   **Luigi Galvani & Alessandro Volta (Late 1700s - Early 1800s):**  This is *crucial* for the Industrial Revolution.  Galvani's experiments with frog legs led him to believe that "animal electricity" was responsible for muscle contractions.  Volta, however, correctly identified that the electricity came from the contact between different metals (zinc and copper).  **Volta's invention of the voltaic pile (the first electric battery) in 1800 is arguably the most important single invention that enabled the practical use of electricity.** It provided a continuous source of electrical current.

**2. Electricity During the Industrial Revolution (18th & 19th Centuries): Key Developments**

*   **Early Applications (Early 1800s):** Volta's battery spurred rapid experimentation.
    *   **Humphry Davy (Early 1800s):** Used electricity to decompose chemicals, leading to discoveries of new elements like sodium and potassium. This had implications for the chemical industry.
    *   **Michael Faraday (1820s-1830s):**  **Faraday's work is absolutely central.** He made several groundbreaking discoveries:
        *   **Electromagnetic Induction (1831):**  Demonstrated that a changing magnetic field could produce an electric current. This is the principle behind electric generators.
        *   **Electrolysis:**  Used electricity to decompose chemical compounds.
        *   **Developed the first electric motor and dynamo (generator).**
*   **Telegraph (1830s-1840s):** Samuel Morse's invention of the telegraph, using electrical signals to transmit messages, was one of the first major practical applications of electricity and revolutionized communication.
*   **Electric Lighting (Late 1800s):**
    *   **Numerous Inventors:**  Many people contributed to the development of electric lighting, including Warren de la Rue, Frederick de Moleyns, and Joseph Swan.
    *   **Thomas Edison (1879):**  Edison's development of a practical incandescent light bulb, along with a system for generating and distributing electricity, was a pivotal moment.  He didn't *invent* the light bulb (others had made earlier versions), but he created a commercially viable and widespread system.
*   **Electric Motors and Industrial Power (Late 1800s):**  The development of efficient electric motors allowed factories to be powered by electricity, leading to increased productivity and the rise of new industries.

**3. Who "Invented" the *Use* of Electricity During the Industrial Revolution?**

This is the most accurate way to frame the question. It wasn't a single invention, but a *process* of innovation and application.  Here's a summary of key contributors:

*   **Alessandro Volta:** For providing the first continuous source of electricity (the battery).
*   **Michael Faraday:** For the fundamental discoveries of electromagnetic induction and the principles behind electric generators and motors.
*   **Samuel Morse:** For the practical application of electricity in communication (the telegraph).
*   **Thomas Edison:** For creating a commercially viable electric lighting system.
*   **Numerous Engineers and Entrepreneurs:**  Many individuals and companies were involved in building the infrastructure (power plants, wiring, etc.) needed to bring electricity to homes and factories.



**In conclusion:** There's no single "inventor" of electricity during the Industrial Revolution. It was a collaborative effort spanning centuries, with key breakthroughs by Volta, Faraday, Morse, and Edison, among many others. The "invention" was really the *application* of electricity to solve practical problems and transform society.
