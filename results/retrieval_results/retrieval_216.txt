Which "Coco" are you referring to?

Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down this playful and layered expression. It's a clever reference combining several pop culture elements. Here's what's going on:

*   **"I'm in love..."**: This is a straightforward declaration of affection.
*   **"...with the coco"**: This is a play on words referencing the song "Coco" by the musical group *Imagine Dragons*. The song is about remembering someone, and the lyrics include the line "I'm gonna be your friend, friend, friend."
*   **"...the coco"**: This is also a reference to Chanel No. 5 perfume, famously advertised with the tagline "Coco Chanel."

**Overall Meaning:**

The phrase "I'm in love with the coco" is a humorous and playful declaration of affection that combines musical and fashion references. It suggests a fondness for both the song "Coco" and the iconic Chanel brand. It's a lighthearted way to express admiration or attraction.

It's a fun, layered, and very modern way to say you're smitten!
