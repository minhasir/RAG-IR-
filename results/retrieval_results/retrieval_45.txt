Standard LLM Answer:
A property tax bill is an example of **a regressive tax**.

Here's why:

*   **Regressive Tax:** A tax that takes a larger percentage of income from lower-income earners than from higher-income earners.
*   **Property Tax & Income:** Property taxes are based on the value of your property, not your income. Therefore, a lower-income person who owns a modestly valued home will pay a larger percentage of their income in property taxes compared to a higher-income person who owns a more expensive home.
