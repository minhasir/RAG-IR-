Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's trace the origins of the surname "Hickey." It's a fairly common name, particularly in Ireland, and its history is quite interesting.

**The Origin: "De hica" - From the Hawthorn Tree**

*   **Old Irish Roots:** The surname Hickey (and its variations like Heaghy, Heffernan, and others) ultimately derives from the Old Irish personal name "Ó hEcataigh."
*   **"Ecataigh" Meaning:** This name is believed to be derived from the word "eca," which means "hawthorn tree." Hawthorn trees were (and still are) significant in Irish folklore and tradition, often associated with boundaries, protection, and fertility.
*   **"Ó" Prefix:** The "Ó" prefix is a very common Irish surname prefix, meaning "descendant of" or "from the family of." So, "Ó hEcataigh" essentially means "descendant of Ecataigh."

**Geographic Distribution and Variations:**

*   **Historically in Ireland:** The name was originally found primarily in County Galway, County Mayo, and County Sligo in western Ireland.
*   **Spelling Variations:** Over time, and due to Anglicization (the process of adapting Irish names to English), the name has evolved into various spellings, including:
    *   Hickey
    *   Heaghy
    *   Heffernan
    *   Hegarty
    *   and others.  These variations often indicate different branches of the same ancestral line.

**Migration and Spread:**

*   **Emigration:**  Like many Irish surnames, Hickey became more widespread due to Irish emigration, particularly during the Great Famine (1845-1849).  Large numbers of Irish people emigrated to the United States, Canada, Australia, and other parts of the world, carrying their surnames with them.
*   **Global Presence:** Today, the name Hickey is found in significant numbers in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, as well as in Ireland.

**In summary, the last name Hickey originates from the Old Irish name "Ó hEcataigh," meaning "descendant of Ecataigh," which is derived from "eca," meaning "hawthorn tree." It's a name with strong Irish roots and a history tied to the landscape and folklore of western Ireland.**



To help me narrow down the information further, could you tell me:

*   **Do you know where your ancestors who had the Hickey surname originally came from (e.g., a specific county in Ireland, or a particular region in another country)?**
*   **Are you interested in a specific branch of the Hickey family tree?**
