RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, I cannot answer this question. The provided text discusses who wrote the song "Who's Making Love," and details events related to Gail moving into an annex and a body-swapping dream sequence, but it does not contain information about anyone "making love" to someone's "old lady."
