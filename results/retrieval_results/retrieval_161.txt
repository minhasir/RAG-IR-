RAG Answer:

Standard LLM Answer:
The moral of the ant and the grasshopper is generally understood to be: **hard work and planning for the future are more rewarding than laziness and living for the present.**

Here's a breakdown of why:

*   **The Grasshopper:** Represents someone who enjoys immediate pleasure and doesn't think about the future. He's carefree but ends up suffering when winter comes.
*   **The Ant:** Represents someone who diligently works and prepares for difficult times. Their efforts pay off when resources are scarce.



It's a cautionary tale about the importance of responsibility and foresight.
