RAG Answer:
Johnny Jewel's band appears throughout the new Twin Peaks.

Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, this is a fun one! The band featured in the new *Twin Peaks* (Season 3, or *Twin Peaks: The Return*) is called **Feelings**.

Here's what makes it so interesting:

*   **It's a real band:** The music for "Feelings" is performed by a real band, also called "Feelings." They are led by Kyle MacLachlan (who plays Agent Cooper) and feature Sheryl Surrense (who also composed music for the show).
*   **It's within the show's reality:** The band "Feelings" exists *within* the world of *Twin Peaks*. They are a band performing in the Roadhouse.
*   **It's a meta-layer:** The music and the band itself are a layer of art within the already surreal and layered show.



So, the answer is **Feelings**.
