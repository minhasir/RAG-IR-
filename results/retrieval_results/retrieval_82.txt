RAG Answer:
Paul Revere, William Dawes, and Prescott warned Concord that the British were coming.

Standard LLM Answer:
This is a classic riddle referencing the "One if by land, two if by sea" warning system used during the American Revolutionary War.

The answer is **Paul Revere**.

Here's why:

*   **The Legend:** Paul Revere is famously known for his "midnight ride" to warn the colonists in Concord and Lexington that the British were coming.
*   **"One if by land, two if by sea":** This was the prearranged signal. A single lantern hung in the Old North Church meant the British were coming by land, while two lanterns signaled they were coming by sea. Revere was part of the system that ensured this warning was delivered.



While William Dawes also rode to warn the colonists, Revere's role is the more well-known and iconic part of the story.
