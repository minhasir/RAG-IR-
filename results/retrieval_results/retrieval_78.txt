RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, I cannot answer this question. The text describes how cases are acquired and what litigants are paid, but it does not mention who is responsible for paying any judgements rendered on the show.

Standard LLM Answer:
This is a fascinating and layered question stemming from a misunderstanding (or perhaps a deliberate play on words!). Let's break it down:

**1. The Core Confusion: "Judge Mathis Show" vs. "Judge Mathis"**

*   **Judge Mathis Show:** This is a popular arbitration-based television show where Judge Mathis resolves disputes between people. It's entertainment.
*   **Judge Mathis:** This refers to the actual person, Honorable Curtis "Judge" Mathis, a former prosecutor and judge in California.

**2. The Question's Layers**

Your question is cleverly constructed with multiple layers:

*   **"Who pays the judgments on the Judge Mathis Show?"** This is the straightforward part. In the show, the parties involved in the dispute are typically responsible for paying any judgments rendered. The show itself doesn't pay.
*   **"Judge mathis show" vs. "Judge Mathis"** This is where the wordplay comes in. You're subtly shifting the question to ask about the *actual* Judge Mathis.
*   **"Who pays the judgments on the Judge Mathis?"** This is the trickiest part. It implies a legal judgment *against* Judge Mathis himself.

**3. The Answer to the "Judge Mathis" Part**

Here's the breakdown of who would be responsible for paying judgments against the *actual* Judge Mathis, depending on the circumstances:

*   **If the Judgment is Related to His Official Duties:** If Judge Mathis were found liable for something he did *while acting in his official capacity* (e.g., a wrongful ruling in a case he presided over), the responsibility would likely fall on the government entity he was employed by (e.g., the California court system).  This is because he was acting as an agent of the state.
*   **If the Judgment is for Personal Conduct:** If the judgment were related to something Judge Mathis did in his *personal* life (e.g., a car accident, a contract dispute unrelated to his judicial work), he would be personally responsible for paying it.  His assets (savings, property, etc.) could be at risk.
*   **Insurance:** Like anyone else, Judge Mathis likely has insurance policies (homeowner's, auto, liability) that could cover some or all of a judgment against him, depending on the nature of the claim and the policy's terms.

**Important Note:** It's highly unlikely that Judge Mathis would face a judgment against him in his personal capacity. He is a respected figure and presumably acts responsibly.



**In conclusion, your question is a clever word puzzle! The answer depends on whether you're asking about the television show or the actual Judge Mathis, and the specific circumstances leading to the judgment.**
