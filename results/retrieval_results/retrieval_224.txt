RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, Good Friday was already a common law holiday and therefore not an official bank holiday in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It was one of the four days observed as holidays by the Bank of England in 1834. The Bank Holidays Act 1871 included it as one of the first official bank holidays.

Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down the history of Good Friday becoming a bank holiday, as it's a bit more complex than a simple date. It's a story of evolving religious observance, social change, and political decisions.

Here's a breakdown, focusing primarily on the UK (as that's where the question likely originates, though similar trends occurred in other Christian-influenced countries):

**1. Early History & Medieval Observance (Pre-1800s):**

*   **Early Christianity:** Good Friday (the Friday before Easter) has always been a day of mourning and remembrance of the crucifixion of Jesus.
*   **Medieval England:**  Good Friday was a *major* religious festival. It was a day of strict observance.  Work was forbidden (except for essential tasks), and there were special church services. It was a legal holiday, meaning courts and some other institutions were closed.  The severity of the restrictions varied over time.
*   **The Reformation (16th Century):** The Reformation brought changes, but Good Friday remained a significant day. However, the level of enforcement of the restrictions began to weaken.

**2. 19th Century: Gradual Erosion of Observance:**

*   **Industrial Revolution:** The rise of factories and a more industrialized society began to challenge the traditional restrictions on work.  The need for continuous production started to conflict with the day of religious observance.
*   **Early Bank Holidays:** In 1871, the Bank Holidays Act was passed. This Act created a list of days when banks and other institutions would be closed.  Initially, Good Friday was *not* included in this list.
*   **Pressure for Inclusion:**  There was increasing pressure from religious groups to have Good Friday included as a bank holiday.

**3. 1900s: The Shift and Modern Status:**

*   **1903:** Good Friday was *finally* added to the list of bank holidays in the UK. This was largely due to lobbying by the Church of England and other religious organizations.  The decision reflected a compromise between the desire for religious observance and the growing demands of a modern economy.
*   **20th and 21st Centuries:**  While Good Friday remains a bank holiday in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, it was *removed* as a bank holiday in Scotland in 1974. This decision reflected Scotland's more secular society and a desire to reduce the number of bank holidays.  There have been ongoing debates about reinstating it in Scotland.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Good Friday has *always* been a day of religious significance, but its status as a day of rest and closure of businesses has evolved over time.
*   The inclusion of Good Friday as a bank holiday was a result of social and political pressures, reflecting the changing relationship between religion and the state.
*   The removal of the holiday in Scotland demonstrates the ongoing debate about the role of religious holidays in a secular society.



Do you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this history, such as the arguments for and against the holiday, or the situation in other countries?
