More formally , the income elasticity of demand , ε d ( \ displaystyle \ \ epsilon _ ( d ) ) , for a given Marshallian demand function Q ( I , P → ) ( \ displaystyle Q ( I , ( \ vec ( P ) ) ) ) for a good is

With income I ( \ displaystyle I ) , and vector of prices P → ( \ displaystyle ( \ vec ( P ) ) ) .

In economics , income elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded for a good or service to a change in the income of the people demanding the good . It is calculated as the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to the percentage change in income . For example , if in response to a 10 % increase in income , the quantity demanded for a good increased by 20 % , the income elasticity of demand would be 20 % / 10 % = 2.0

Many necessities have an income elasticity of demand between zero and one : expenditure on these goods may increase with income , but not as fast as income does , so the proportion of expenditure on these goods falls as income rises . This observation for food is known as Engel 's law .

In this case increase in income is accompanied by relatively larger increase in quantity demanded .

In this case increase in income is accompanied by same proportionate increase in quantity demanded .

RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, the income elasticity of demand for a normal good is always greater than one. The text states: "Many necessities have an income elasticity of demand between zero and one... In this case increase in income is accompanied by relatively larger increase in quantity demanded." This implies that for a normal good (which isn't a necessity), the quantity demanded increases more than proportionally to the increase in income, resulting in an income elasticity greater than one.

Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down this concept and answer your question.

**Understanding Income Elasticity of Demand**

Income elasticity of demand (YED) measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good or service to a change in consumer income.  It's calculated as:

YED = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Income)

**Normal Goods vs. Inferior Goods**

*   **Normal Goods:**  As income rises, demand for these goods *increases*. People buy more of them when they have more money.
*   **Inferior Goods:** As income rises, demand for these goods *decreases*. People buy less of them when they have more money (they switch to higher-quality or preferred alternatives).

**The Key Question: Income Elasticity of Demand for a Normal Good**

You specifically asked about **normal goods**.  Here's the crucial point:

*   **For a normal good, the income elasticity of demand is always positive.**  This is because an increase in income *always* leads to an increase in demand.

*   **The magnitude (size) of the value matters:**
    *   **YED < 1:**  The good is a **necessity**. Demand increases, but less than proportionally to the increase in income. (e.g., food - people will buy more food as they earn more, but not a huge amount more).
    *   **YED > 1:** The good is a **luxury**. Demand increases more than proportionally to the increase in income. (e.g., expensive cars, designer clothes - people buy significantly more of these as they get richer).

**Therefore, the answer to your question is:**

**The income elasticity of demand for a normal good is always positive.**
