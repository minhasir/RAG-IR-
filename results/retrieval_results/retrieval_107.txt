RAG Answer:
The central contention of Andrew Carnegie's "The Gospel of Wealth" is that the wealthy have a responsibility to redistribute their surplus means in a responsible and thoughtful manner, and that ostentatious living and amassing private treasures are wrong.

Standard LLM Answer:
The central contention of Andrew Carnegie's "The Gospel of Wealth" is that **the wealthy have a moral obligation to give back to society during their lifetime, rather than passing their fortunes to their heirs.**

Here's a breakdown of the key ideas:

*   **Wealth is often a product of luck and circumstance, not solely individual merit.** Carnegie acknowledges that factors beyond a person's control often contribute to their wealth.
*   **The wealthy have a responsibility to be stewards of their wealth.** They shouldn't hoard it or pass it down to their children, who may not be capable of using it wisely.
*   **The best way to distribute wealth is through philanthropy.** He advocates for using wealth to fund institutions and programs that benefit society, such as libraries, universities, and scientific research.
*   **Inheritance can be detrimental.** He believed that inheriting large sums of money can discourage hard work and initiative.
*   **The goal is to create a society where the wealthy actively contribute to the progress and betterment of all.**



Essentially, Carnegie argues that the wealthy have a duty to use their resources to improve society and leave a lasting legacy of positive change.
