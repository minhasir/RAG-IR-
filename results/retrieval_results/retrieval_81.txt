RAG Answer:
Yes, according to the provided information, those born in the United States are considered natural born citizens, and no person is eligible to the office of President unless he is a natural born citizen.

Standard LLM Answer:
Yes, according to the "natural born citizen" clause of the U.S. Constitution (Article II, Section 1), a president *must* be a natural-born citizen. This has historically been interpreted to mean born within the borders of the United States, although the exact legal definition has been debated.

Therefore, to be President of the United States, a person *must* be born in the United States.



Here's a bit more detail:

*   **The Natural Born Citizen Clause:** This clause states that "No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President."
*   **Historical Interpretation:** Historically, "natural born citizen" has been understood to mean someone born within U.S. territory.
*   **Legal Debates:** There have been legal debates and theories about whether someone born abroad to U.S. citizen parents could still be considered a natural-born citizen, but the prevailing understanding and legal precedent strongly support the requirement of birth within the U.S.



This requirement is why the question of Barack Obama's citizenship (born in Hawaii) was raised, though it was ultimately dismissed.
