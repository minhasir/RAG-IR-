. As part of this investigation , phoneticians may concern themselves with the physical properties of meaningful sound contrasts or the social meaning encoded in the speech signal ( socio - phonetics ) ( e.g. gender , sexuality , ethnicity , etc . ) . However , a substantial portion of research in phonetics is not concerned with the meaningful elements in the speech signal .

In contrast to phonetics , phonology is the study of how sounds and gestures pattern in and across languages , relating such concerns with other levels and aspects of language . Phonetics deals with the articulatory and acoustic properties of speech sounds , how they are produced , and how they are perceived

Phonetics ( pronounced / fəˈnɛtɪks / ) is the branch of linguistics that studies the sounds of human speech , or -- in the case of sign languages -- the equivalent aspects of sign . It is concerned with the physical properties of speech sounds or signs ( phones ) : their physiological production , acoustic properties , auditory perception , and neurophysiological status . Phonology , on the other hand , is concerned with the abstract , grammatical characterization of systems of sounds or signs .

RAG Answer:
The study of the physical properties of sounds is phonetics.

Standard LLM Answer:
You're getting at the core of it! Here's a breakdown and a more complete answer:

**What you're describing is Acoustics.**

Here's a more detailed explanation:

*   **Sound:** Sound is a vibration that travels through a medium (like air, water, or solids).
*   **Acoustics:** The study of sound is called **acoustics**. It encompasses a *huge* range of topics, including:
    *   **Physical Properties:** How sound waves are generated, how they travel, their speed, wavelength, frequency, and amplitude. This is what you were initially focusing on.
    *   **Perception:** How humans (and animals) hear and interpret sound.
    *   **Applications:** Acoustics is applied in many fields, such as:
        *   Architecture (designing concert halls, reducing noise)
        *   Music (instrument design, recording)
        *   Medicine (ultrasound)
        *   Engineering (noise control)

**Therefore, the study of the physical properties of sounds is Acoustics.**



You were on the right track! It's a fascinating field.
