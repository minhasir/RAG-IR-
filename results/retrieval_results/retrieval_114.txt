Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down the goods the US trades with Canada. It's a *massive* trade relationship, so this will be a fairly detailed overview.

**The US is Canada's largest trading partner, and Canada is the US's largest export market.**  The relationship is deeply integrated.

Here's a breakdown, separated into US exports to Canada and US imports from Canada, with some key categories highlighted:

**1. US Exports to Canada (What the US Sells to Canada):**

*   **Machinery:** This is a *huge* category. It includes industrial machinery, computers, electrical equipment, and more.  It's a cornerstone of the trade relationship.
*   **Vehicles:** Cars, trucks, and auto parts are a significant export.  The automotive industry is highly integrated between the two countries.
*   **Chemicals:** A wide range of chemicals, including plastics, resins, and specialty chemicals.
*   **Computer and Electronic Products:**  This includes semiconductors, computer components, and finished electronics.
*   **Agricultural Products:**
    *   **Soybeans:** A major export.
    *   **Corn:** Another significant agricultural export.
    *   **Wheat:**  Important for Canadian food processing.
    *   **Meat (Beef, Pork):**  Significant trade in both directions, but the US is a net exporter.
*   **Oil and Petroleum Products:** While Canada is a major oil producer, the US exports refined petroleum products and some crude oil.
*   **Paper and Wood Products:**  While Canada is a major exporter of these, the US also exports some.
*   **Pharmaceuticals:**  A growing area of trade.

**2. US Imports from Canada (What the US Buys from Canada):**

*   **Energy Products (Oil & Natural Gas):** This is *the* dominant import category. Canada is a major supplier of oil and natural gas to the US.
*   **Vehicles:** Similar to exports, the automotive industry is integrated. The US imports vehicles manufactured in Canada.
*   **Wood and Paper Products:** Canada is a major exporter of lumber, pulp, and paper.
*   **Aluminum:** Canada is a significant supplier of aluminum to the US.
*   **Chemicals:**  Similar to exports, a wide range of chemicals are traded.
*   **Agricultural Products:**
    *   **Potatoes:** A significant import.
    *   **Canola (Rapeseed Oil):**  Important for food processing.
*   **Minerals and Metals:**  Including iron ore, nickel, and other metals.
*   **Pharmaceuticals:**  Canada also exports pharmaceuticals.

**Key Trends & Considerations:**

*   **Integrated Supply Chains:**  Many industries have highly integrated supply chains across the US and Canada.  Goods often cross the border multiple times during the manufacturing process.
*   **USMCA (formerly NAFTA):** The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement governs trade between the three countries. It has rules of origin and other provisions that affect trade flows.
*   **Regional Differences:** Trade patterns vary by region within both countries.
*   **Services Trade:** While this response focuses on goods, it's important to note that services trade (tourism, financial services, etc.) is also a significant part of the US-Canada economic relationship.
