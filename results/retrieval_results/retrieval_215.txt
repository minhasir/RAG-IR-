Question: where does the flexor digitorum superficialis distally attach

Reference Answer: Four long tendons come off this muscle near the wrist and travel through the carpal tunnel formed by the flexor retinaculum . These tendons , along with those of flexor digitorum profundus , are enclosed by a common flexor sheath . The tendons attach to the anterior margins on the bases of the intermediate phalanges of the four fingers . These tendons have a split ( Camper 's Chiasm ) at the end of them through which the tendons of flexor digitorum profundus pass .

It is in the anterior compartment of the forearm . It is sometimes considered to be the deepest part of the superficial layer of this compartment , and sometimes considered to be a distinct , `` intermediate layer '' of this compartment . It is relatively common for the Flexor digitorum superficialis to be missing from the little finger , bilaterally and unilaterally , which can cause problems when diagnosing a little finger injury .

The Flexor digitorium superficialis muscle is innervated by the median nerve ( C7 , C8 , T1 ) .

The primary function of flexor digitorum superficialis is flexion of the middle phalanges of the fingers at the proximal interphalangeal joints , however under continued action it also flexes the metacarpophalangeal joints and wrist joint .

Flexor digitorum superficialis ( flexor digitorum sublimis ) is an extrinsic flexor muscle of the fingers at the proximal interphalangeal joints .

RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, I cannot answer this question. The provided text describes the muscle's location, innervation, and function, but does not specify where it distally attaches.

Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down the distal attachment of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscle.

Here's the answer, with details:

**The flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscle's distal attachment is to the middle phalanges of the second, third, fourth, and fifth digits (fingers). Specifically, it inserts via tendons onto the palmar aponeurosis and then onto the sides of the middle phalanx.**

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **Tendons:** The FDS muscle belly is located in the forearm. It transitions into long tendons that run down the hand.
*   **Palmar Aponeurosis:** These tendons initially converge and insert into the palmar aponeurosis (a broad sheet of connective tissue on the palm of the hand).
*   **Middle Phalanges:** From the palmar aponeurosis, the tendons branch out and attach to the sides of the middle phalanges of the second, third, fourth, and fifth digits (fingers). The thumb (first digit) does *not* have an FDS tendon.
*   **Insertion Points:** The tendons insert onto the medial and lateral surfaces of the middle phalanx.

**In summary, the FDS muscle's distal attachment is to the sides of the middle phalanges of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers.**
