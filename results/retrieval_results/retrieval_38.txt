RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, I cannot answer this question. The text mentions the "SUVAT equations" which relate displacement, initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and time in circumstances of constant acceleration, but it does not provide the equation itself.

Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down the equation for velocity under constant acceleration. The most common and useful form is:

**v = u + at**

Where:

*   **v** = final velocity (what velocity the object has at the end of the time period)
*   **u** = initial velocity (what velocity the object has at the beginning)
*   **a** = acceleration (the rate of change of velocity - constant in this case)
*   **t** = time (the duration over which the acceleration is applied)

**Explanation:**

This equation states that the final velocity of an object is equal to its initial velocity plus the product of its acceleration and the time.

**Example:**

A car starts from rest (u = 0 m/s) and accelerates at a constant rate of 2 m/s² for 5 seconds. What is its final velocity (v)?

*   u = 0 m/s
*   a = 2 m/s²
*   t = 5 s

v = u + at
v = 0 + (2 m/s²)(5 s)
v = 10 m/s

Therefore, the car's final velocity is 10 m/s.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Units:** Make sure all your units are consistent (e.g., meters for distance, seconds for time, meters per second for velocity, meters per second squared for acceleration).
*   **Direction:** Velocity and acceleration are vector quantities, meaning they have both magnitude and direction.  You need to consider the signs (+ or -) to represent direction. For example, if acceleration is in the opposite direction of the initial velocity, 'a' would be negative.
*   **Constant Acceleration:** This equation *only* applies when the acceleration is constant. If the acceleration changes over time, you're dealing with a more complex problem.
