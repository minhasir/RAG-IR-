RAG Answer:
St. Elmo's Fire takes place at Georgetown University.

Standard LLM Answer:
You're asking a great question that circles back on itself! Let's break it down:

*   **St. Elmo's Fire** is a luminous electrical discharge caused by a strong electric field.
*   **Where does it take place?** It typically occurs on pointed objects during thunderstorms. Common locations include:
    *   Ship masts
    *   Lightning rods
    *   Towers
    *   Trees
    *   Even the wings of airplanes

So, your question "where does St. Elmo's Fire take place" is essentially asking the same thing as "what are the typical locations where St. Elmo's Fire occurs?"



Hopefully, that clarifies things!
