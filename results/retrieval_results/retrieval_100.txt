Hypersalivation ( also called ptyalism or sialorrhea ) is excessive production of saliva . It has also been defined as increased amount of saliva in the mouth , which may also be caused by decreased clearance of saliva .

Hypersalivation can contribute to drooling if there is an inability to keep the mouth closed or in difficulty in swallowing the excess saliva ( dysphagia ) and lead to excessive spitting .

Hypersalivation also often precedes emesis ( vomiting ) , where it accompanies nausea ( a feeling of needing to vomit ) .

Conditions that can cause saliva overproduction include :

Medications that can cause overproduction of saliva include :

Hypersalivation is optimally treated by treating or avoiding the underlying cause . Mouthwash and tooth brushing may have drying effects .

The name `` lie bumps '' is a result of a myth that telling lies would cause them . However , very little has been written about this condition in scientific articles or textbooks and scientific studies have failed to produce a definite cause . Possible causes include : `` stress , gastrointestinal upset , menstruation , acidic or sour food , smoking , and local trauma '' ( direct physical irritation ) of the tongue . Lie bumps are often caused by the taste bud ( s ) splitting .

RAG Answer:
Hypersalivation (also called ptyalism or sialorrhoa) is excessive production of saliva. It has also been defined as an increased amount of saliva in the mouth.

Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down what might be causing excessive saliva (having a lot of saliva). It's a common issue, and there are several potential causes, ranging from simple to more complex. Here's a breakdown, categorized by likelihood and severity:

**1. Common & Usually Temporary Causes (Most Likely):**

*   **Acid Reflux/GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease):** This is a *very* common culprit. Stomach acid flowing back into the esophagus can irritate it, triggering increased saliva production as a protective mechanism. The saliva tries to neutralize the acid.
*   **Morning Mouth/Increased Saliva Production:** Some people naturally produce more saliva in the morning. This is often related to changes in hormone levels or changes in the oral environment overnight. It's usually harmless.
*   **Strong Flavors/Smells:** Strong tastes (like sour or spicy foods) or smells can stimulate saliva production. This is a normal physiological response.
*   **Anxiety/Stress:** Anxiety and stress are well-known triggers for many physical symptoms, including increased saliva. Your body goes into "fight or flight" mode, and saliva production can increase.
*   **Medications:** Many medications can cause dry mouth *or* excessive saliva as a side effect. This is because they can affect the balance of saliva production and swallowing. Common culprits include:
    *   Certain antidepressants (especially SSRIs)
    *   Some antipsychotics
    *   Medications for Parkinson's disease
    *   Certain blood pressure medications
    *   Some pain medications
*   **Pregnancy:** Hormonal changes during pregnancy can sometimes lead to increased saliva production (ptyalism).

**2. Less Common, But Possible Causes:**

*   **Dental Issues:**
    *   **Poorly Fitting Dentures:** Dentures that don't fit properly can irritate the mouth and stimulate saliva production.
    *   **Dental Infections/Abscesses:** Infections in the mouth can cause inflammation and increased saliva.
    *   **Gum Disease (Gingivitis/Periodontitis):** Inflammation of the gums can also contribute.
*   **Nasal Congestion/Postnasal Drip:** When you have a cold, allergies, or sinus problems, mucus can drip down the back of your throat, irritating it and triggering saliva production.
*   **Neurological Conditions:** In rare cases, neurological conditions (like stroke, Bell's palsy, or Parkinson's disease) can affect the nerves that control saliva production.
*   **Gastrointestinal Issues:**  Beyond just acid reflux, other GI problems can sometimes be linked to increased saliva.
*   **Allergies:** Allergic reactions can sometimes cause increased saliva.

**3. Rare Causes:**

*   **Tumors:** Very rarely, tumors in the mouth or salivary glands can cause excessive saliva.
*   **Sj√∂gren's Syndrome:** This is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the moisture-producing glands (salivary and tear glands). While it's more commonly associated with dry mouth, some people experience increased saliva initially.



**What to Do:**

1.  **Observe and Track:** Pay attention to *when* you notice the increased saliva. Is it related to meals, stress, certain medications, or specific times of day? Keeping a log can be helpful.
2.  **Try Simple Remedies:**
    *   **Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush and floss regularly to remove food particles and bacteria.
    *   **Chew Sugar-Free Gum or Suck on Sugar-Free Candy:** This stimulates saliva flow and can help clear the mouth.
    *   **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water can help.
    *   **Avoid Trigger Foods:** If you notice certain foods worsen the problem, try avoiding them.
3.  **Review Medications:**  Check the side effects of any medications you're taking. Talk to your doctor if you suspect a medication is the cause.
4.  **See a Doctor or Dentist:**  **It's important to see a healthcare professional if:**
    *   The excessive saliva is persistent and bothersome.
    *   You have other symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, sore throat, or heartburn.
    *   You suspect a dental problem.
    *   You have any concerns about a possible underlying medical condition.
