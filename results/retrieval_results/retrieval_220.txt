RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, the last movie of Divergent, initially planned as a theatrical release titled "The Divergent Series: Ascendant," was announced to be released as a TV movie. The information does not specify a release date for this TV movie.

Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down the situation with the "Divergent" movie series. This is a bit complicated because of what happened with the planned films.

**Here's the history and the current status:**

1.  **"Divergent" (2014):** The first film, based on the first book, was a success.
2.  **"Insurgent" (2015):** The second film also performed well.
3.  **"Allegiant" (2016):** This is where things went sideways. The third book, "Allegiant," was originally planned to be split into two movies. The first part, "Allegiant," was released, but it underperformed at the box office.
4.  **The Planned Sequel Was Canceled:** Because "Allegiant" didn't make enough money, the studio (Summit/Lionsgate) canceled the planned second part, which would have adapted the final book, "Ascendant."

**Therefore, there is no "last movie" of the Divergent series that was ever released.** The story of "Divergent" remains unfinished on screen. The final book, "Ascendant," was never adapted into a film.

**Is there any hope for the story to continue?**

*   **Rumors and Discussions:** There have been occasional rumors and discussions about potentially revisiting the series, perhaps with a reboot or a new adaptation. However, as of today (November 16, 2023), there are no concrete plans for a new "Divergent" movie.

**In short, the last movie released was "Allegiant" in 2016, and the story was left unfinished.**
