RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, I cannot answer this question. The provided text details the director, actors Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins, and other production details, but does not mention a baby actor.

Standard LLM Answer:
This is a tricky one because the baby in *The Blue Lagoon* was played by **Christopher Brough**.

Here's why it's confusing and some extra details:

*   **Christopher Brough** played the baby Richard.
*   **Leo Hatchet** played the young Richard.
*   **Max von Sydow** and **Geneviève Bujold** played the adult Richard and Emeline respectively.



It's a memorable role, but the actor who played the baby is often overlooked!
