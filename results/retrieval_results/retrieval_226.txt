Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down where Spain sailed to establish its colonies. It was a vast and impactful undertaking! Here's a breakdown, categorized for clarity:

**1. The Americas (The Biggest Focus):**

*   **Caribbean Islands:** This was Spain's initial foothold. They began colonizing islands like:
    *   **Hispaniola (modern-day Dominican Republic and Haiti):** Christopher Columbus landed here in 1492, and it was the first major Spanish colony.
    *   **Cuba:** Became a crucial strategic location.
    *   **Puerto Rico:** Another important island.
    *   **Jamaica (briefly):** Briefly held by the Spanish before being taken by the English.
*   **Central America:**
    *   **Belize:** Briefly a Spanish colony.
    *   **Guatemala:** Colonized and became a Captaincy General.
    *   **Honduras:** Part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala.
    *   **Nicaragua:** Also part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala.
    *   **Costa Rica:**  The most distant and sparsely populated of the Central American colonies.
    *   **Panama:**  Important for the route to South America and the Pacific.
*   **South America:**
    *   **Venezuela:** Colonized and became a Captaincy General.
    *   **Colombia:** Part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada.
    *   **Ecuador:** Part of the Viceroyalty of Peru.
    *   **Peru:**  A major focus, with the discovery of silver at Potosí (in modern-day Bolivia) fueling immense wealth for Spain. Became the Viceroyalty of Peru.
    *   **Bolivia:** Initially part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, later part of Upper Peru.
    *   **Chile:** Colonized later, facing resistance from indigenous populations.
    *   **Argentina:** Colonized relatively late and sparsely.
    *   **Paraguay:** Colonized and became a Jesuit mission area.
*   **North America:**
    *   **Florida:** Colonized in the 16th century, but faced challenges from indigenous populations and other European powers.
    *   **Southwest (present-day US):**  Including parts of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.  Established missions and presidios (forts) to exert control and convert indigenous people.  This area was part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain.

**2. Asia and the Pacific:**

*   **Philippines:**  A crucial colony for trade and a strategic location in Southeast Asia.  Spain colonized the Philippines in the 16th century and held it for over 300 years.
*   **Pacific Islands:** Spain claimed and briefly controlled some islands in the Pacific, including:
    *   **Mariana Islands (Guam, Saipan, Tinian):**  Important for trade routes.
    *   **Carolines:**  A large archipelago.
    *   **Palau:**  Another island group.

**3. Africa (Limited Presence):**

*   **Western Sahara:** Briefly controlled a portion of this territory in Northwest Africa.
*   **Equatorial Guinea:**  Established a small presence on the west coast of Africa.

**Key Points to Remember:**

*   **Viceroyalties:** Spain organized its vast empire into Viceroyalties, which were large administrative regions governed by a Viceroy appointed by the Spanish monarch. The main Viceroyalties were:
    *   **New Spain:**  Included Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and parts of the Southwest US.
    *   **Peru:** Included much of South America.
*   **Trade Routes:** Spain's colonial voyages were driven by the desire for wealth – gold, silver, and other resources.  They established extensive trade routes connecting Spain to its colonies.
*   **Motivations:**  The voyages were motivated by a combination of factors: the desire for new trade routes to Asia, the search for precious metals, the spread of Christianity, and the expansion of Spanish power.
