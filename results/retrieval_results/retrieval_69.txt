Standard LLM Answer:
This is a wonderfully layered question that gets to the heart of a running gag in "How I Met Your Mother"! Here's the breakdown:

*   **Ted is talking about the "Yellow Umbrella" incident.** Throughout the series, Ted frequently reminisces about a rainy day when he saw a woman under a yellow umbrella. He's captivated by her and believes it was a significant moment, a sign of his future love.
*   **The woman under the yellow umbrella is Tracy McConnell.** She is Ted's future wife.
*   **Therefore, Ted is talking about Tracy when he talks about the yellow umbrella.** It's a recurring motif representing the beginning of their relationship.

So, the answer is **Tracy McConnell**. It's a clever way the show uses a seemingly random detail to build anticipation and reveal a crucial part of Ted's story.
