Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down where British Airways (and its partner airlines) flies in South America. It's a bit complex due to codeshares and partnerships, but I'll give you a comprehensive overview.

**Key Hubs & Main Destinations:**

*   **Brazil:** This is the biggest market for BA in South America.
    *   **São Paulo (GRU):** Daily flights from London Heathrow. This is a major hub for onward connections within Brazil and South America.
    *   **Rio de Janeiro (GIG):**  Flights from London Heathrow.
    *   **Brasília (BSB):** Served via codeshares with partner airlines (usually LATAM).
    *   **Belo Horizonte (CNF):** Served via codeshares with partner airlines (usually LATAM).
    *   **Salvador (SSA):** Served via codeshares with partner airlines (usually LATAM).
    *   **Porto Alegre (POA):** Served via codeshares with partner airlines (usually LATAM).
*   **Colombia:**
    *   **Bogotá (BOG):** Flights from London Heathrow.
    *   **Cali (CLO):** Served via codeshares with partner airlines (usually Avianca).
    *   **Medellín (MDE):** Served via codeshares with partner airlines (usually Avianca).
*   **Argentina:**
    *   **Buenos Aires (EZE):** Flights from London Heathrow.
*   **Chile:**
    *   **Santiago (SCL):** Flights from London Heathrow.

**Other Destinations (Often via Codeshares - Primarily with LATAM and Avianca):**

*   **Ecuador:**
    *   **Guayaquil (GYE):** Codeshare with Avianca.
    *   **Quito (UIO):** Codeshare with Avianca.
*   **Peru:**
    *   **Lima (LIM):** Codeshare with Avianca.
*   **Uruguay:**
    *   **Montevideo (MVD):** Codeshare with LATAM.
*   **Paraguay:**
    *   **Asunción (ASU):** Codeshare with LATAM.
*   **Bolivia:**
    *   **La Paz (LPB):** Codeshare with LATAM.

**Important Notes & Details:**

*   **Codeshares are Key:** British Airways doesn't operate *all* of these flights directly. A significant portion are codeshares, meaning BA sells tickets on flights operated by partner airlines (primarily LATAM and Avianca).  When booking, pay attention to the operating carrier.
*   **LATAM Partnership:**  The LATAM partnership is extensive.  You're likely to find BA codeshare flights on many LATAM routes within South America.
*   **Avianca Partnership:** Similar to LATAM, BA has a codeshare agreement with Avianca, providing access to several destinations in Colombia and other parts of South America.
*   **Frequency:** Flight frequency varies greatly depending on the destination. Major hubs like São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Buenos Aires have daily or near-daily flights from London.  Smaller cities are typically served less frequently, often only a few times per week, and almost always via codeshare.
*   **Seasonal Changes:** Some routes may be seasonal, with reduced or no service during certain times of the year.
*   **Check the BA Website:** The most up-to-date information on routes and schedules is always on the British Airways website ([https://www.britishairways.com/](https://www.britishairways.com/)). Use their route map tool to explore destinations.



To help me narrow down the answer, could you tell me:

*   Are you interested in a specific country or city in South America?
*   Are you looking for direct flights only, or are codeshares acceptable?
