The year 2003 was a turning point for the Kit Kat bar as well as the confectionery industry in general . The popularity of low carb diets and the push to healthier eating stifled sales growth in many parts of the world .

Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down the ingredients in a standard Kit Kat bar (as of my last knowledge update - ingredients can sometimes vary slightly by region). Here's a comprehensive list, categorized for clarity:

**1. Chocolate Coating (Milk Chocolate):**

*   **Sugar:** The primary sweetener.
*   **Cocoa Butter:** A fat from the cocoa bean, giving chocolate its smooth texture.
*   **Skim Milk Powder:** Adds milk solids for a creamier flavor.
*   **Cocoa Mass (or Cocoa Liquor):** Ground cocoa beans, providing the chocolate flavor.
*   **Lecithin (Soy):** An emulsifier, helping the ingredients blend smoothly.
*   **Natural Flavor:** A flavoring agent (often vanilla).

**2. Wafer Layers:**

*   **Wheat Flour:** The base of the wafer.
*   **Sugar:** Sweetener.
*   **Palm Fat:** Vegetable fat used for texture and crispness. (Note: This is a point of concern for some due to sustainability issues with palm oil production. Some Kit Kat varieties use alternatives.)
*   **Corn Starch:** A thickening agent.
*   **Salt:** Enhances flavor.
*   **Raising Agent (Sodium Bicarbonate):** Helps the wafers rise and become light.

**Important Notes & Potential Variations:**

*   **Region-Specific Differences:** Ingredient lists can vary slightly depending on the country where the Kit Kat is manufactured.
*   **Allergens:** Kit Kats contain **wheat (gluten)** and **soy**. They may also be manufactured in facilities that process **milk, peanuts, tree nuts, and eggs**, so there's a risk of cross-contamination. Always check the packaging for specific allergen warnings.
*   **Palm Oil:** As mentioned, the use of palm oil is a concern for some.  Nestlé (the maker of Kit Kat) has made commitments to sourcing sustainable palm oil, but it's still present in many versions.
*   **Dark Chocolate Kit Kats:** These will have a different chocolate coating with a higher percentage of cocoa solids and less or no milk solids.



**To get the *absolute* most accurate and up-to-date ingredient list, it's always best to check the packaging of the specific Kit Kat bar you're interested in.**
