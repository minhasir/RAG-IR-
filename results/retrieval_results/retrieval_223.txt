RAG Answer:
The amount of light reflected from the front surface of common window glass is about 4% per surface.

Standard LLM Answer:
This is a fascinating and surprisingly complex question! Here't a breakdown of the answer, why it's tricky, and the best estimate we can give:

**The Core Issue: It's Not About Reflection Alone**

The question asks about "light reflected from the front surface." While reflection *does* happen at the front surface of glass, it's a very small amount compared to what happens *within* the glass. Here's why:

*   **Refraction:** Most of the light that hits glass doesn't bounce directly back. Instead, it *refracts* – it bends as it enters the glass due to the change in density.
*   **Internal Reflection & Transmission:** This refracted light travels through the glass, bouncing internally between the surfaces. Some of this light is transmitted (passes through) the glass, and some is reflected internally.
*   **Surface Reflection:** A small portion of the light is reflected directly at the front surface. This is what the question is asking about, but it's a minor contributor to the overall brightness we perceive.

**Estimating the Surface Reflection**

*   **Theoretical Reflection:**  Theoretically, the reflection at an air-glass interface (like a window) is about 4% for light perpendicular to the surface. This is based on the difference in refractive indices (approximately 1.5 for glass vs. 1.0 for air).
*   **Real-World Factors:** However, several factors reduce this:
    *   **Angle of Incidence:** Light rarely hits the glass perfectly perpendicularly. At oblique angles, reflection increases.
    *   **Surface Imperfections:** Scratches, dust, and other imperfections scatter light, reducing the specular (mirror-like) reflection.
    *   **Glass Composition:** Different types of glass have slightly different refractive indices, affecting reflection.
    *   **Polarization:** Light is polarized, and the amount of reflection depends on the polarization.

**Best Estimate**

Considering all these factors, the amount of light reflected from the *front surface* of common window glass is likely in the range of **0.5% to 2%**.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Cleanliness:** A perfectly clean window will reflect slightly more.
*   **Angle:** The reflection will be higher at shallow angles (e.g., looking at a window at sunset).
*   **Perceived Brightness:**  Even though the reflection is small, it can be noticeable, especially if the surroundings are bright.



**Therefore, the best answer to your question is approximately 0.5% to 2%.**
