The Gulf of Mexico ( Spanish : Golfo de México ) is an ocean basin and a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean , largely surrounded by the North American continent . It is bounded on the northeast , north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States , on the southwest and south by Mexico , and on the southeast by Cuba . The U.S

The Gulf of Mexico formed approximately 300 million years ago as a result of plate tectonics . The Gulf 's basin is roughly oval and is approximately 810 nautical miles ( 1,500 km ; 930 mi ) wide and floored by sedimentary rocks and recent sediments . It is connected to part of the Atlantic Ocean through the Florida Straits between the U.S. and Cuba , and with the Caribbean ( with which it forms the American Mediterranean Sea ) via the Yucatán Channel between Mexico and Cuba

Today , the Gulf of Mexico has the following 7 main areas :

RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, I cannot answer this question. The text describes the Gulf of Mexico but does not provide a map or visual representation.

Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down a map of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Here's a description, focusing on key features and how they connect. I'll organize it into sections: **The Gulf of Mexico**, **The Atlantic Ocean (Connecting Areas)**, and **Key Features & Considerations**.  Since I can't *show* you a map, I'll be as descriptive as possible.  I'll also suggest search terms you can use to find good visual maps online.

**1. The Gulf of Mexico**

*   **Shape & Size:** The Gulf of Mexico is a large, roughly circular gulf. It's significantly smaller than the Atlantic Ocean itself. Think of it as a large, inward-facing curve of the Atlantic.
*   **Location:** It's located between the southeastern coast of the United States and the eastern coast of Mexico and Cuba.
*   **Borders:**
    *   **North:** Florida (USA)
    *   **East:** Cuba
    *   **South:** Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico)
    *   **West:** Mexico (Tamaulipas, Veracruz, and Tabasco states)
*   **Depth:** The Gulf is relatively shallow compared to the Atlantic. The average depth is around 1,270 meters (4,170 feet).  The deepest point is in the Sigsbee Deep, located in the western part of the Gulf.
*   **Major Rivers:** Several large rivers drain into the Gulf, including:
    *   Mississippi River (USA) - *The* dominant river, delivering a huge volume of freshwater and sediment.
    *   Rio Grande (USA/Mexico)
    *   Sabine River (USA)
    *   Pearl River (China - a distant source, but its waters eventually reach the Gulf via the Caribbean Sea)

**2. The Atlantic Ocean (Connecting Areas)**

The Gulf of Mexico doesn's just sit there; it's connected to the vast Atlantic Ocean. Here's how:

*   **Straits of Florida:** This is the primary and most significant connection. It's a narrow channel between Florida (USA) and Cuba. It's a busy shipping route. The Gulf Stream flows through this area.
*   **Yucatan Channel:**  Located between Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula.  This is a smaller connection point.
*   **Caribbean Sea:** The Gulf of Mexico is often considered part of the larger Caribbean system. The Caribbean Sea lies to the south of Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula, and it connects to the Atlantic.  The Gulf and Caribbean are interconnected.
*   **North Atlantic:**  From the Straits of Florida, the waters flow into the North Atlantic.
*   **South Atlantic:**  From the Caribbean Sea, waters flow into the South Atlantic.

**3. Key Features & Considerations**

*   **The Gulf Stream:** This is a *very* important feature. It's a warm, swift Atlantic current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the eastern coast of the United States and across the Atlantic towards Europe. It significantly influences the climate of both regions.  It flows *out* of the Gulf through the Straits of Florida.
*   **Loop Current:**  Within the Gulf, the warm water of the Gulf Stream forms a rotating eddy called the Loop Current. This current can bring warm water and nutrients into the Gulf.
*   **Salinity:** The salinity (saltiness) of the Gulf is lower than the open Atlantic due to the large influx of freshwater from rivers.
*   **Sedimentation:** The Mississippi River deposits a massive amount of sediment into the Gulf, creating a large delta and influencing the seabed.
*   **Hurricanes/Cyclones:** The Gulf of Mexico is prone to hurricanes (also called cyclones or typhoons in other parts of the world). Warm waters fuel these storms.
*   **Marine Life:** The Gulf is rich in marine life, including fish, shrimp, oysters, and various other species.
