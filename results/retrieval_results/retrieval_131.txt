RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, I cannot answer this question. The text states people ask Rip Van Winkle "how he voted," but it does not mention him asking for anyone.

Standard LLM Answer:
This is a tricky question that gets at a common misunderstanding of the story!

Rip Van Winkle **doesn's ask anyone for anything** when he returns to the village. He's bewildered and disoriented. He simply asks **"Where's my gun? Where's my powder?"** He's looking for his hunting gear, not asking for help or information.

The villagers, of course, are shocked to see him and don't recognize him at first.
