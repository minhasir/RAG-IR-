RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, the orange stuff on your sushi could be tobiko (flying fish roe). Natural tobiko has a red-orange color. It's also possible it's tobiko that has been colored with yuzu, which makes it a pale orange (almost yellow).

Standard LLM Answer:
The orange stuff on your sushi is most likely **salmon roe**, also known as **ikura**. 

Here's a breakdown:

*   **What it is:** Ikura are the eggs of the salmon fish. They're a delicacy in many cultures, especially in Japanese cuisine.
*   **Taste:** They have a salty, slightly briny, and often a subtly sweet taste. The texture is usually a "pop" when you bite into them.
*   **Why it's on sushi:** It's a popular topping for sushi, adding both flavor and visual appeal.

While less common, it *could* be another type of fish roe, but salmon roe (ikura) is by far the most likely.
