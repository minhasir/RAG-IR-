*   **Key Recommendations & Impact:** The Islington Commission's report led to significant changes:

    *   **Training:** It emphasized the need for better training for civil servants, both in the UK and in India.
    *   **Indian Representation:** While the commission didn't immediately lead to a large increase in Indian representation, it did acknowledge the need for greater inclusion in the civil service.
