The P wave in the ECG represents atrial depolarization , which results in atrial contraction , or atrial systole .

The P wave is a summation wave generated by the depolarization front as it transits the atria . Normally the right atrium depolarizes slightly earlier than left atrium since the depolarization wave originates in the sinoatrial node , in the high right atrium and then travels to and through the left atrium . The depolarization front is carried through the atria along semi-specialized conduction pathways including Bachmann 's bundle resulting in uniform shaped waves

If P waves are not clearly delineated in the surface ECG , a Lewis lead may be used to better visualize P waves .

Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down the meaning of the P-wave phase in an electrocardiogram (ECG).

**What is an ECG (EKG)?**

An ECG is a non-invasive test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It's a crucial tool for diagnosing various heart conditions.

**What is the P-Wave?**

The P-wave on an ECG represents **atrial depolarization**.  Let's unpack that:

*   **Atria:** These are the two upper chambers of your heart (left and right atria).
*   **Depolarization:** This is the electrical process that triggers the contraction (squeezing) of the heart muscle.  When the atria are about to contract, they become electrically charged (depolarized).  The P-wave reflects this electrical change.

**The P-Wave Phase and What it Represents**

The *phase* of the P-wave refers to its timing and morphology (shape).  Here's what it signifies:

*   **Normal P-Wave:** A normal P-wave is typically small, rounded, and upright (positive) in lead II (a standard ECG lead). It indicates that the electrical impulse is originating in the sinoatrial (SA) node (the heart's natural pacemaker) and spreading through the atria in a coordinated manner.
*   **Abnormal P-Wave:** Changes in the P-wave's shape, size, or timing can indicate various atrial abnormalities, such as:
    *   **Atrial Enlargement:** A larger-than-normal P-wave can suggest that one or both atria are enlarged.
    *   **Atrial Fibrillation:** A chaotic, irregular pattern instead of a distinct P-wave.
    *   **Other Atrial Abnormalities:**  Various other changes can indicate specific atrial conduction problems or structural issues.

**In Summary**

The P-wave phase of an ECG represents **the electrical activation (depolarization) of the atria**. Its shape, size, and timing provide valuable information about the health and function of the atria.
