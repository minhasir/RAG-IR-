Okay, let's break down when the Model Code of Conduct for AI comes into force. Here's the key information, based on the OECD's documentation:

**The Model Code of Conduct comes into force on August 1, 2024.**

Here's a more detailed explanation and important nuances:

*   **Voluntary Adoption:** The Model Code is *voluntary*. It's not a legally binding regulation. Organizations are encouraged to adopt and implement it.
*   **Implementation Timeline:** While the Code comes into force on August 1, 2024, the OECD anticipates that full implementation will take time. They encourage organizations to start integrating the principles and guidelines as soon as possible.
*   **Ongoing Development:** The OECD intends to regularly review and update the Model Code based on experience and technological advancements. This means the Code will evolve over time.
*   **Purpose of the Date:** The August 1, 2024 date serves as a benchmark for organizations to align their AI governance practices with the OECD's recommendations.
