RAG Answer:
Emmett Smith, Helio Castroneves, Hines Ward, Donald Driver, Rashad Jennings, and Adam Rippon.

Standard LLM Answer:
You're posing a fun and increasingly specific question! Let's break it down and see who has won both competitive dancing (like ballroom or Latin) *and* Dancing with the Stars. It's a surprisingly small group.

Here's a breakdown of athletes who have achieved both, with varying degrees of prominence in each field:

*   **Rashad Jennings (NFL):** This is probably the most well-known example. He was a running back in the NFL and then won *Dancing with the Stars* in 2017. He had a background in competitive dance before his football career.
*   **Donald Driver (NFL):** A wide receiver for the Green Bay Packers, Driver won *Dancing with the Stars* in 2012. He had some dance experience growing up.
*   **Shawn Johnson East (Gymnastics):** A highly decorated Olympic gymnast, Johnson East was a runner-up on *Dancing with the Stars* and then won *Dancing with the Stars: Athletes* in 2016.
*   **Apolo Anton Okafor (Speed Skating):** An Olympic silver medalist in speed skating, Okafor won *Dancing with the Stars* in 2014.
*   **James Van Der Beek (Hockey):** While primarily known as an actor (from *Dawson's Creek*), Van Der Beek played professional hockey briefly. He won *Dancing with the Stars* in 2023.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Defining "Competitive Dancing":** The level of competitive dance experience varies greatly among these athletes. Some had significant training before their professional sports careers, while others had more casual involvement.
*   **"Athletes" Seasons:** *Dancing with the Stars* has had seasons specifically for athletes, which naturally increases the chances of seeing athletes who have some dance background.
