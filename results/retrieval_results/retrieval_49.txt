RAG Answer:
English - Jamaican singer Rikrok sings with Shaggy on "It Wasn't Me."

Standard LLM Answer:
This is a wonderfully layered and delightfully absurd question referencing a series of internet memes! Let's break it down and answer it.

The question is a reference to the "Shrek is Love, Shrek is Life" meme, which itself is a parody of cult-like devotion. The phrase "Shrek is Love, Shrek is Life" is often followed by increasingly bizarre and nonsensical additions.

Your question, "Who sings with Shaggy on me?" is a further extension of this absurdity, referencing the song "Me Love You" by Shaggy featuring Bob Marley.

**The answer, in the spirit of the meme, is:**

**"It's me, Shrek!"**

It's a nonsensical, recursive answer that fits the escalating absurdity of the meme chain. It's a playful response that acknowledges the layered references.

Hopefully, that satisfies the meme-loving part of your brain! ðŸ˜„
