Question: what is the champions league quarter final draw

Reference Answer: Each tie in the knockout phase , apart from the final , is played over two legs , with each team playing one leg at home . The team that scores more goals on aggregate over the two legs advance to the next round . If the aggregate score is level , the away goals rule is applied , i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advances . If away goals are also equal , then thirty minutes of extra time is played . The away goals rule is again applied after extra time , i.e. if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level , the visiting team advances by virtue of more away goals scored . If no goals are scored during extra time , the tie is decided by penalty shoot - out . In the final , which is played as a single match , if scores are level at the end of normal time , extra time is played , followed by penalty shoot - out if scores remain tied .
