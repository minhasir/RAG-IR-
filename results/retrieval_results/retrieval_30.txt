The table above summarizes the various blood groups that children may inherit from their parents . Genotypes are shown in the second column and in small print for the offspring : AO and AA both test as type A ; BO and BB test as type B . The four possibilities represent the combinations obtained when one allele is taken from each parent ; each has a 25 % chance , but some occur more than once .

. A couple with type A and type B can also have a type O child if they are both heterozygous ( I i , I i ) The cis - AB phenotype has a single enzyme that creates both A and B antigens . The resulting red blood cells do not usually express A or B antigen at the same level that would be expected on common group A or B red blood cells , which can help solve the problem of an apparently genetically impossible blood group .

Ludwik Hirszfeld and E. von Dungern discovered the heritability of ABO blood groups in 1910 -- 11 . Felix Bernstein demonstrated the correct blood group inheritance pattern of multiple alleles at one locus in 1924 . Watkins and Morgan , in England , discovered that the ABO epitopes were conferred by sugars , to be specific , N - acetylgalactosamine for the A-type and galactose for the B - type

RAG Answer:
inheritance of the a b o blood groups is an example of multiple alleles at one locus.

Standard LLM Answer:
Inheritance of the A, B, O blood groups is an example of **multiple alleles**.

Here's why:

*   **Multiple Alleles:** This refers to a gene having more than two possible alleles (versions). The ABO blood group system is controlled by a single gene (the *IA* gene), but it has three common alleles: *IA*, *IB*, and *i*.
*   **Single Gene, Multiple Alleles:** While the ABO blood type is determined by one gene, the different alleles (*IA*, *IB*, and *i*) result in different phenotypes (blood types A, B, AB, and O).
