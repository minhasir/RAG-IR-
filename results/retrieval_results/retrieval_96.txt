RAG Answer:
Iaan Bekker designed the national coat of arms of South Africa.

Standard LLM Answer:
The national coat of arms of South Africa was designed by a team led by **State Herald Ian Sinton**. However, it's important to understand it was a collaborative effort drawing on historical and cultural symbolism. Here's a breakdown of the key contributors and the process:

*   **Ian Sinton (State Herald):** He was the lead designer and oversaw the entire project. He is credited with the overall concept and design.
*   **André Heywood (Artist):** Heywood was the artist who executed the final design based on Sinton's specifications. He is responsible for the detailed artwork.
*   **A Committee of Experts:** A committee comprised of heraldry experts, historians, and cultural representatives was formed to advise on the symbolism and ensure its appropriateness. This included people from various cultural groups within South Africa.
*   **Public Consultation:** There was a period of public consultation to gather feedback on the proposed designs.

**Therefore, while Ian Sinton is considered the lead designer, it was a collaborative effort involving multiple individuals and a process of public input.**
