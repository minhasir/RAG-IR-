RAG Answer:
Based on the provided information, I cannot answer this question. The text describes the concept of enthalpy of formation and provides an example with lithium fluoride, but it does not provide any information about the enthalpy of formation of CaO(s) or any other specific compound.

Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down the enthalpy of formation of CaO(s).

**Understanding Enthalpy of Formation**

The enthalpy of formation (ΔH<sub>f</sub>) is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states (usually 298 K and 1 atm).  By definition, the enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard state is zero.

**The Reaction for CaO(s) Formation**

Calcium oxide (CaO) is formed from its elements, calcium (Ca) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:

Ca(s) + 1/2 O<sub>2</sub>(g) → CaO(s)

**The Enthalpy of Formation Value**

The standard enthalpy of formation of CaO(s) is **-635.1 kJ/mol**.

**Where to Find This Value**

You can find this value in several places:

*   **Chemistry Textbooks:** Most general chemistry textbooks will have a table of standard enthalpies of formation.
*   **Online Databases:**
    *   **NIST Chemistry WebBook:** [https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/](https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/) (Search for "CaO")
    *   **ThermoNet:** [https://thermoprog.net/](https://thermoprog.net/)

**Important Notes:**

*   The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic, meaning heat is released during the formation of CaO.
*   The units are typically kJ/mol (kilojoules per mole).
*   The value is specific to the standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm).



Let me know if you'd like to explore how to use this value in other thermodynamic calculations (like Hess's Law)!
