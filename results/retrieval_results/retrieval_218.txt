Standard LLM Answer:
This is a fascinating and much-discussed topic! Here's a breakdown of what's known and the prevailing theories about who Demi Lovato's song "Stone Cold" is about:

**The Leading Theory: Wilmer Valderrama**

*   **Timing:** The song was released in 2015, shortly after Demi and her then-boyfriend, Wilmer Valderrama, ended their six-year relationship.
*   **Lyrics:** The lyrics are incredibly specific and emotionally charged, detailing a breakup where one person is trying to move on while the other is still deeply in love. Lines like "I gave you all of me, and you gave me nothing in return" and "I'm still in love with you" strongly suggest a long and complex relationship.
*   **Confirmation (Sort Of):** While neither Demi nor Wilmer have explicitly confirmed the song is about him, Wilmer did a very telling reaction to the song on social media. He posted a picture of himself looking thoughtful with the caption, "Wow. Just wow. #StoneCold." This reaction was widely interpreted as an acknowledgment of the song's subject.
*   **Their Relationship:** Demi and Wilmer's relationship was long and significant, and they were very public about it for many years. The song's lyrics align with reports and speculation about the difficulties and eventual end of their relationship.

**Other Theories (Less Likely):**

*   **Joe Jonas:** Some initially speculated about Joe Jonas due to a past relationship and a similarly dramatic breakup. However, the lyrics don't align as closely as they do with Wilmer.
*   **General Heartbreak:** It's possible the song is a composite of experiences and not about one specific person, but the specificity of the lyrics makes this less probable.

**In Conclusion:**

While there's no official confirmation, the overwhelming evidence – the timing, the lyrics, and Wilmer Valderrama's reaction – strongly suggests that "Stone Cold" is about their relationship.



**Disclaimer:** *It's important to remember that this is speculation based on available information. Ultimately, only Demi Lovato knows the full story behind the song.*
