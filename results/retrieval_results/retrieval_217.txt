Standard LLM Answer:
Okay, let's break down the "Daniel in the Bible mini-series" question, as it has a bit of history and multiple versions.

**The Most Popular Version: "The Young Daniel" (1997)**

*   **Daniel was played by:** Michael Shanks. He's probably the most widely recognized actor to portray Daniel in a mini-series adaptation. This was a very popular, four-part series.

**Other Notable Adaptations:**

*   **"Daniel" (1975):** This was a British-German co-production. Daniel was played by **Richard Warwick**. This is a much older and less frequently seen version.
*   **"The Bible" (2013):** This History Channel mini-series featured **Douglas Booth** as Daniel. This was a very large-scale production with a lot of attention.

**Therefore, the most common answer you'll likely be looking for is Michael Shanks.**



Do you want me to elaborate on any of these versions or provide more details about the actors or the series?
