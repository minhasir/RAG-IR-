what are the parts of the finger called,Finger,"Although a common phenomenon , the underlying functions and mechanism of fingertip wrinkling following immersion in water are relatively unexplored . Originally it was assumed that the wrinkles were simply the result of the skin swelling in water , but it is now understood that the furrows are caused by the blood vessels constricting due to signalling by the sympathetic nervous system in response to water exposure . One hypothesis for why this occurs , the `` rain tread '' hypothesis , posits that the wrinkles may help the fingers grip things when wet , possibly being an adaption from a time when humans dealt with rain and dew in forested primate habitats . A 2013 study supporting this hypothesis found that the wrinkled fingertips provided better handling of wet objects but gave no advantage for handling dry objects . However , a 2014 study attempting to reproduce these results was unable to demonstrate any improvement of handling wet objects with wrinkled fingertips .",,
